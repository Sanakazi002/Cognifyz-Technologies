I have worked on 3 levels of this internship. I have used python languague to uncover my insights and for the decision making. Firstly i have performed data cleaning using pandas library.
and replaced the missing values with the mode as the data type of the column was categorical. Then i have done Data exploration to find out what variables and its type are present in the dataset.
After all this, i have started performing the levels assigned to me. 
Level 1 helped me to understand the type of chart to be used depending on the data type and the way we want to interpret it.
Level 2 was based on analyzing the trend and similarity for which i have used K-Means clustering and to find the optimum value of k I further used Elbow method. Also used cartopy library to plot locations on geospatial map.
In level 3, I have used correlation to analyze if there is a correlation between the number of votes and the rating of a restaurant.
All these levels also helped me to learn nested filtering and groupby function. It helped me to improve my thinking skills that is to connect the previous findings with the current one.
